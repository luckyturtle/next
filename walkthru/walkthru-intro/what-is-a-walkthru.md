Let's first clear up something that may be confusing: 

"Walkthru" (with a capital "W") is the name of the app while a "walkthru" (with a small "w") is what we call the tutorial that you'll write and display with Walkthru.

Simple enough, right?!

A walkthru will have multiple steps that are defined in individual markdown files. Each step consists of text instructions (displayed here on the left side) and a code file (displayed on the right side).

In fact, the code file you're viewing is the same one used to define this step! ðŸ¤¯
