## Hello

A tutorial created with Walkthru (called a *walkthru* with a small "w") consists multiple steps that are defined in individual markdown files. 

Each step consists of text instructions (displayed here on the left side) and a code file (displayed on the right side).

In fact, the code file you're viewing is the same one used to define this step! ðŸ¤¯
