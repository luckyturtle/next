A *walkthru* can be thought of as a multi-step tutorial. Each step consists of text instructions (here on the left side of the page) and a code file (on the right side).

To create a walkthru step you'll define a markdown file which references a file in a GitHub repo.

In fact, the file you're viewing is the file used to define this step!
