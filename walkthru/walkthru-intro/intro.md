**Walkthru** is an alternative to a blog post tutorial that provides a better way of walking through code.

Walkthru is open source and is useful in these scenarios:

- Explaining a product
- Teaching

In fact, you're looking at a Walkthru right now! It gets weirder though - the code we're going to walkthrough is the source code of this very page.

Click "Next" and you'll get a quick tour of Walkthru and understand how it works.
