One of the most useful features of Walkthru is the ability to highlight specific parts of the code.

To do this, set the `focus` property in the frontmatter and indicate the lines to highlight. 

You can also specify the `center` property which indicates which line should be in the center of the page when scrolled to. This is useful in larger files as you'll see in a moment.
